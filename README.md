Queryable is a mixin that allows you to easily define query objects with chainable scopes.

### Scopes

Scopes serve to encapsulate reusable business rules, a method is defined with
the selected name and block (or proc)

### Scopeable Methods

While scopes are great because of their terseness, they can be limiting because
the block executes in the context of the internal query, so methods, constants,
and variables of the Queryable are not accessible.

For those cases, you can use a normal method, and then `scope` it. Queryable
will take care of setting the return value of the method as the internal query,
and return `self` at the end to make the method chainable.

### Delegation

By default most Array methods are delegated to the internal query. It's possible
to delegate extra methods to the query by calling `delegate`.
```ruby
def CustomersQuery
  delegate :update_all, :destroy_all
end
```

## Usage
```ruby
class CustomersQuery
  include Queryable

  scope(:recent) { desc(:logged_in_at) }

  scope :active, ->{ where(status: 'active') }

  scope :favourite_brand do |product, brand|
    where("favourites.#{product}": brand)
  end

  def current
    recent.active
  end

  def miller_fans
    favourite_brand(:beer, :Miller)
  end

  scope def search(field_values)
    field_values.inject(customers) { |customers, (field, value)|
      customers.where(field => /#{value}/i)
    }
  end

  def search_in_current(field_values)
    search(field_values).current
  end

  scope :search_in_current
end


CustomerQuery.new(shop.customers).miller_fans.search_in_current(last_name: 'M')
```

## Optional Modules
Besides Queryable, there are two opt-in modules that can help you when creating
query objects. These modules would need to be manually required during app
initialization or wherever necessary (in Rails, config/initializers).

### DefaultQuery
Provides default initialization for query objects, by attempting to infer the
class name of the default collection for the query, and it also provides a
`queryable` method to specify it.

```ruby
require 'queryable/default_query'

def CustomersQuery
  include Queryable
  include Queryable::DefaultQuery
end

def OldCustomersQuery < CustomersQuery
  queryable ArchivedCustomers
end

CustomersQuery.new.query == Customer.all
OldCustomersQuery.new.query == ArchivedCustomers.all
```
### DefaultScope
Allows to define default scopes in query objects, and inherit them in query
object subclasses.

```ruby
require 'queryable/default_scope'

def CustomersQuery
  include Queryable
  include Queryable::DefaultScope
  include Queryable::DefaultQuery

  default_scope :active
  scope :active, -> { where(:last_purchase.gt => 7.days.ago) }
end

def BigCustomersQuery < CustomersQuery
  default_scope :big_spender
  scope :big_spender, -> { where(:total_expense.gt => 9999999) }
end

CustomersQuery.new.query == Customer.where(:last_purchase.gt => 7.days.ago)

BigCustomersQuery.new.query ==
Customer.where(:last_purchase.gt => 7.days.ago, :total_expense.gt => 9999999)
```

### Notes
To avoid repetition, it's a good idea to create a `BaseQuery` object
to contain both the modules inclusion, and common scopes you may reuse.

```ruby
require 'queryable/default_query'
require 'queryable/default_scope'

def BaseQuery
  include Queryable
  include Queryable::DefaultScope
  include Queryable::DefaultQuery
  
  scope :recent, ->{ where(:created_at.gt => 1.week.ago) }
end

def CustomersQuery < BaseQuery
...
end
```

## Advantages

* Query objects are easy to understand.
* You can inherit, mixin, and chain queries in a very natural way.
* Increased testability, pretty close to being ORM/ODM agnostic.

## Testing

You can check the [specs](https://github.com/ElMassimo/queryable/tree/master/spec) of the project
to check how to test query objects without even having to require the ORM/ODM, or
you can test by requiring your ORM/ODM and executing queries as usual.
